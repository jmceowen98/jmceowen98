A little bit about myself 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @jmceowen98, a 25-year-old Virgo passionate about all things tech. Ever since I was a small child, I've dreamed of working in the computer field, and I'm now on the path to making that a reality.

ðŸ’¼ I'm a proud business owner and a dedicated parent to two amazing elementary-age sons. Alongside my tech interests, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for herbs, growing plants, and maintaining a vegetable garden.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm diving deep into cybersecurity, combining my love for tech with a drive to protect and secure digital spaces.

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: I've been playing the alto saxophone since I was 13!

Don't hesitate to contact me through email if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
